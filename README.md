## Description

This project is a remake of the classic arcade game **Galaga**, developed as part of a programming project. Galaga is a space shooter game where the player controls a spaceship that must defend against waves of alien enemies. Our remake stays true to the original with some modern enhancements and adjustments.

## Game Features

- **Player's Ship**: The player controls a ship that can move horizontally and shoot projectiles to destroy enemies.
- **Enemy Waves**: Enemies appear in formations and perform coordinated attacks while trying to capture the player's ship.
- **Firepower**: As the player progresses, they can gain power-ups that enhance their firepower or increase the speed of their shots.
- **Scoring**: The player earns points for each enemy destroyed and can earn extra lives by reaching certain score thresholds.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: As the player advances, the waves of enemies become faster and more challenging to defeat.

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using **Claude 3.5** to help generate part of the game's code and logic. The main programming language is **Python**, along with **Pygame** to handle graphics and event management.
